# Extra

## 9.0 For MacOS user who often use F1 - F12
 *  If you are using MacOS, Fn + F1 – F12 would not work as you expected.
ksmigrod explanied the reason for the problem in reddit. \
  “On Linux in Bluetooth mode this keyboard is supported by Apple keyboard driver. This driver tries to mimic Apple keyboard behaviour and does conversion from function key (F1-F12) to media key codes on the fly. NiZ keyboard does not send any codes for its function key, so Linux's keyboard driver cannot map Fn+F1 to F1.” \
 https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/6yieo6/review_plum_84_35g_bluetooth_nonrgb/   \
Though he explained the solution in Linux, it seems it doesn't apply to MacOS. \
Instead, I suggest you to toggle following macOS option as you want.  \
(System Preferences > Keyboard > Use F1, F2, etc. keys are standard function keys …)

### _**Additional Notes**_
When using the KBD84 software to program the keyboard, be sure to select ReadAll first.  This reads the current keyboard mappings from the keyboard.  If you don’t select ReadAll first, you will be essentially starting with blank mappings and you will need to map every single key.
